# Animal Classification (Convolutional Neural Network)

The Animal Classification task involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of animals into different categories. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and extract relevant features from images.
